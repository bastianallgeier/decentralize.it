# SASSAS

This SMART-ASS-SASS boilerplate is my default setup for new projects using <http://inuitcss.com>

## Installation 

Create an assets folder with the following structure (only a suggestion):

	/assets
	/assets/css
	/assets/images
	/assets/js

Open your assets folder in the terminal and clone the scss repository :

		git clone --recursive https://github.com/bastianallgeier/sassas.git scss
	
Go to your scss folder in the terminal and start watching changes in your scss files with the ./watch script. This will automatically create all css files in /assets/css

		./watch
